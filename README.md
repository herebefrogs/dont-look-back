# Don't Look Back!

Enjoy the stunning beauty of the Wild West, but beware of outlaws lurking around: They'll keep coming back to pester you more than you can imagine...

Don't Look Back is a short WebXR game of cowboys and chickens made with A-Frame for JS13K Games 2019 on the theme "Back", inspired by carnival shooting galleries and my love for pixelart.

## Getting started

- Run `npm install`
- Then run `npm run-s dev` to serve the game locally (with live-reload on changes)
- or run `npm run-s build` to build the game bundle (minified and compressed) for JS13K Games submission

## Controls:

Don't Look Back supports all 3DoF devices; no controller is required to play the game.
Shoot chickens and outlaws by gazing at them. Chickens act as a safe playground for you to experiment with the game mechanics before your curiosity kills the cat and starts the game...

## Web monetization:

Coil subscribers get 20% more outlaws to shoot at and get addressed as "Cowboy Coil"!

Tested on:
- Chrome & Firefox, Google Cardboard and Oculus Go (I never managed to enable VR mode on Google DayDream)
- thanks to JulienK for testing Coil subscribers add-ons.

## Things that didn't make the cut:

I started halfway through the competition this year and I ran out of time to add the following:
- idle/death sprite animations for outlaws and chickens,
- Western ambient music,
- aiming/shooting with 3DoF controllers (Oculus Go, DayDream) if present
