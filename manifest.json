  "description": "Enjoy the stunning beauty of the Wild West, but beware of outlaws lurking around: They'll keep coming back to pester you...\n\nDon't Look Back is a short WebXR game of cowboys and chickens made with A-Frame, inspired by carnival shooting galleries and my love for pixelart.\n\nControls:\n- Don't Look Back supports all 3DoF devices; no controller is required to play the game.\n- Shoot chickens and outlaws by gazing at them. Chickens act as a safe playground for you to experiment with the game mechanics before your curiosity kills the cat and starts the game...\n\nWeb monetization:\n-Coil subscribers get 20% more outlaws to shoot at and get addressed as \"Cowboy Coil\"!\n\nTested on:\n- Chrome & Firefox, Google Cardboard and Oculus Go (I never managed to enable VR mode on Google DayDream)\n\nThings that didn't make the cut:\n- idle/death sprite animations for outlaws and chickens,\n- Western ambient music,\n- aiming/shooting with 3DoF controllers (Oculus Go, DayDream) if present",
